    "## 1. Active shape models\n",
    "\n",
    "In object detection, model-based vision allows for the recognition and location of known objects or patterns despite the presence of occlusive phenomena (e.g. noise). But what if the appearance of the object varies? This is where rigid models become inefficient. Active shape models (ASMs) are statistical models of the shape of objects which iteratively deform to fit to an example of the object in a new image. Iterative deformation is achieved by active **segmentation** preceded by registration of a model to the new image. For a detailed explanation of ASM priciples, **please read carefully the following article**: [Cootes et al. Active Shape Models - Their Training and Application, Computer Vision and Image Understanding (1994)](http://dns2.asia.edu.tw/~ysho/YSHO-English/2000%20Engineering/PDF/Com%20Vis%20Ima%20Und61,%2038.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, an ASM aims to find shapes and acceptable variations of an object in a new image based on the model created from a sufficiently large training dataset. Variations in an active shape from a training phase are used to predict variation of unknown objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ASM describes a $K$-dimensional shape that has $L$ boundary points in a *shape feature vector* $\\mathbf{s} = (s_{0}, s_{1}, ..., s_{N}) = (x_{1,1} x_{1,2} ... x_{1,L}, x_{2,1} x_{2,2} ... x_{2,L}, ..., x_{K,1}, ... x_{K,L})$, where $x_{k,l}$ denotes the *k*th component of the *l*th boundary point $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With increasing $K$ dimension of the shape feature vector, more samples in the feature space are needed to compute a reliable estimate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An ASM is defined by its probability density function (PDF) that reflects deformation within an object class. Computation of a probabilistic shape model from training samples is typically performed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify several points on the object boundary to select landmarks (Note: semantic equivalence of selected landmarks across all training data needs to be assured)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - primary landmarks are anatomical landmarks equivalent to anatomical locations (e.g. the brain's Sylvian fissure)\n",
    "    - secondary landmarks are other image features, e.g. ridge intersections on the brain surface\n",
    "    - tertiary landmarks are used to represent curvature of the shape boundary\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Align landmarks within a common coordinate system \n",
    "3. Decorrelate the estimated covariance matrix to obtain uncorrelated features with eigenvectors of that covariance matrix\n",
    "4. Clean up the feature space by only keeping significant variations that lie below some percentage of the total variance in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may correctly anticipate, there are several bottlenecks present in the process of estimating the probabilistic shape model. Semantic equivalence is often difficult, let alone impossible to determine. Moreover, human interaction is required for landmark detection, which is rarely feasible in medical practice. Hence, landmark detection is conducted based on local attributes (e.g. curvatures), geometric shape features or registration of atlases. Moreover, landmark alignment based on invalid assumptions about the object's coordinate system may cause wrong shape variation. Last but not least, the limited amount of training samples typically present in practice leads to a decrease in the significance of the estimated probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Using ASMs for segmentation tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, most of the issues related to estimating the probability density function of an ASM represent classification problems. Hence, the ASM approach is suitable for segmentation tasks. The main idea is to apply an ASM such that its shape is aligned and deformed to fit a potential shape instance in an image. ASM-assisted segmentation is done in the following steps:\n",

    "1. Register an active shape model with new image data that contain a shape which is not accounted for in the shape model in terms of position, orientation and scale\n",
